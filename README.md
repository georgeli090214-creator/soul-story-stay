## Key Components Architecture

### Authentication System
- **Role-based access control** with three user types: `student`, `host_family`, `admin`
- **Database triggers** automatically create user profiles on signup
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies protect user data
- **Supabase Auth** handles email verification and session management

### Inquiry Management
- **Real-time connection requests** between students and families
- **Status tracking** system: `pending` ‚Üí `accepted`/`declined`
- **Bi-directional messaging** with family response capabilities
- **Dashboard integration** for both user types

### Data Security
- **RLS policies** ensure users can only access their own data
- **Authenticated API calls** with automatic session validation
- **Database triggers** prevent direct client-side profile insertion
- **Type-safe database operations** with generated TypeScript types
